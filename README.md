## About The Project

GitHub User App is a GitHub user search application using Github Token. There is a bookmark feature to save user favorites and a dark mode feature to set the application theme. 
This repository is the result of my submission in Dicoding class "Belajar Fundamental Aplikasi Android" that implement Room, dataStore, SearchView, tabLayout & viewPager2, and Dependency Injection. This repo is intended asa personal archive and reference for Dicoding friends who are working on their BFAA class submissions.
